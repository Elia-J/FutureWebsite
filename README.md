We have build our application using NEXT.JS

Because we use a database with personal info, we have decided to host our application

This way, you can see our code and see the product without installing anything on your computer too

NEXT.JS is easily hostable with vercel, but we could only make it work with github.

So you can take a look in our code in the github repository, especially in the pages and components folder, because that is where the magic happens

The link to our website is: https://future-website.vercel.app/

The following section is for Nick:
> Because we switched from Gitlab to github, you cannot see our changes. <br />
> For that reason we ask you to take a look in our Gitlab. https://git.science.uu.nl/0866296/future<br />
> Note that this is not the current version of the project. Elia made some changes to make it hostable.<br />
